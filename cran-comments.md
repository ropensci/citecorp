* This is a new submission, so there are no reverse dependencies.

---

This is a new release. I have read and agree to the the
CRAN policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

This is a re-submission of this package with changes to examples: some examples are now run on check if the external web service is operating normally; not all examples are run as some take too long and are wrapped in \donttest{}.

Thanks!
Scott Chamberlain
